# Checklist for Reviewing Lessons (Both Readings and Labs) 

## Giving Feedback
* Be super positive. Always point out what you enjoyed and what you feel works well. 
* If you have feedback, ask it through questions rather than by dictating what the writer should do. 

## FOR READINGS: 

### Read the Lesson in its entirety without commenting or changing anything. 
* Make sure that everything is correct. 
* If there is an example that you don’t quite follow or if something seems off, then write it out yourself or look it up. 
* Go through all of the example code and make sure that you can follow it and that it runs correctly. 
* Correct minor spelling and grammar changes (no need to bother writers with that stuff unless it becomes a big pattern.)

### Start with the overview (if the lesson begins with one)
* Is it brief, friendly, and to the point? 
* Would this lesson benefit from an overview? If this is a particularly difficult topic, then an overview will help provide context and prime students. If the answer is yes, could you add one in? 

### Move on to the objectives
* Are the objectives specific, observable, and have specific conditions or criteria? 
* Do they avoid starting with the following verbs: understand, learn, know? 
* Are there more than two and less than eight of them? 
* Since you’ve read the lesson already once, does the lesson cover all of the learning objectives listed?
* Does the lesson cover objectives that weren’t listed?

### Move on to the body of the lesson
* Does it start with a programming concept or real-world example that the student is already familiar with? 
* Are “big words” explained? Are the explanations given before the actual term is used? 
* Does the lesson build up and resolve tension steadily? 
* Are metaphors, examples, and/or scenarios used frequently? 
* Is it written using second person (“you”) and first person plural (“we”)
* Are explanations clear and friendly
* Is it not overly dry and humorless?
* Bonus: are there gifs?

### Code in the body of the lesson
* Is every new part of a code block or snippet explained? 
* Can a student copy the code as is into a repl or file and it will run correctly? 
* Does the lesson go in detail and step-by-step through every manipulation of the code? 
* If it’s a codealong, then are all the files and starter code given? 

### Wrapping Up
* Does the new content presented solve the initial problem that the lesson started with? 
* If it’s a lengthy lesson, are the core concepts recapped? 
* Was the lesson engaging, friendly, and avoided writing “glorified documentation?” 

## FOR LABS

### Run the Lab
* Clone it down and run the solution branch. Make sure that it passes. If not, then there are problems and you’ll need to investigate further. 

### Read the Readme
* Is there an introduction that gives a practical, real-world problem that the student needs to solve? 
* Are the instructions clear but read more like requirements rather than a step-by-step how-to to solve the lab? 
* Make sure that the instructions are not too obscure. We don’t want students diving into the weeds. However, if we deliberately want students to google or figure out something on their own, make sure that this is stated. 

### Instructions in the Readme
* Do the instructions follow the general order that students should be solving the lab?
* Do the tasks increase in complexity 

### Everything else
* Read through all of the code (both setup and solution) and comment on anything that strikes me as clever or in need of changing.
